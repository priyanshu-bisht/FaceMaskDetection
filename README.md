# 👾 __Face Mask Detection__  
- In the time of Covid Pandemic WHO and Governments are enforcing people to follow some norms which aren't being followed by people. So to Keep a check on their and everyone's safety we could use this _Face Mask Detection_ Technique.
- This Project is made using the _OpenCV_ & _TensorFlow_ in Python.
- Face Detection Classifier: _Haarcascade_.
- Works on Images, Recorded Videos & Live Feed.

# 📦 __Prerequisites__
- Haarcascade Frontal Face [Github link](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).
- Face Mask Dataset [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset).

# 💽 __Models__
- __model01__ - Bigger Model (More Accurate)
- __model099__ - Smaller Model (Less Accurate)
- __Haarcascade__ - Face Detection Model

# 🌊 __Flow__
- Detect Face using Haarcascade.
- Use the Trained Model to classify.
